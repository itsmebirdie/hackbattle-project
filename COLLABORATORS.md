# BASED POSITIVE NEWS EXTRACTOR

this is a website based in Python and Flask, which extracts news from google news's RSS Feed, and filters only the positive ones out from them and shows it to the user.

The website will have different categories to choose from, i.e, Tech, India, Space, Fashion, Sports, etc, etc.

It will also be having a weather report on top, to imitate the normal news websites.

There will be a search functionality to search for specific but positive news from the web. If searched for negative news, it will show a sentiment error.

The news would also have details of the news pull, such as, the reporter, the date and time of reporting, the category of news, and a 'Read Post' Button to check out the full news on the external website.
